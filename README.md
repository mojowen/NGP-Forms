## NGP Donations

### Configuration

Go to `Settings -> General` and fill out the "NGP API Key", "Donation Support Phone Line", and "Addt'l Information for Donation Footer" fields.

"NGP API Key" is how this plugin authenticates with your NGP VAN service.

"Donation Support Phone Line" is shown with the error message when the contribution gets rejected by the NGP VAN server.

"Addt'l Information for Donation Footer" might be used for listing things like donation mailing address, donation limits, taxable status of donations, etc.

## Alert!

You should be running your site under an SSL certificate if you utilize this plugin.
